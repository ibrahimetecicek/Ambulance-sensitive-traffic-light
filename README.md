# Ambulance sensitive traffic light with Arduino
The project is working that: When the ambulance comes the traffic light is green. After the ambulance passes, it returns to normal operation. We used a button as a sensor because there is no sensor and we cannot model it in isis. The logic of the sensor and the button is the same as the logic of 1.0. When you see the ambulance, the button will be pressed, so the green light will be on. After 5 seconds (we can change this time from the program) I said 5 seconds, the ambulance will not stay for 10 hours because the middle of the road. After 5 seconds of stay and ambulance, normal traffic light will return to working flow.
